This is the source code for an app that provide a friendly-user interface of the "gather" function [(tidyr package)](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr).

To run it locally, you'll need to install the latest versions of  [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com), [Shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/), and [tidyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr).

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "tidyr"))
```

You may need to restart R to make sure the newly-installed packages work properly.

After all these packages are installed, you can run this app by running the following code in R:

```s
runGitHub("reshape", "panduze")
```
